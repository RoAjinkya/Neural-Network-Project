# Neural Network Project

  # Brief Introduction: 
    
    The project is build to perform handwritten digit recognization using machine learning preceptron algorithm. The 
    model is developed using Java OOP concepts. The test and train data can be used to perform the respective
    functions. The model developed works with an accuracy of 99% approximately. 
    
  # Development Details:
